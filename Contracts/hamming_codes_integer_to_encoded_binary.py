# HammingCodes: Integer to Encoded Binary
#
# You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining,
# after which the contract will self-destruct.
#
# You are given the following decimal Value: 1056111410136
#
# Convert it into a binary string and encode it as a 'Hamming-Code'. eg: Value
# 8 will result into binary '1000', which will be encoded with the pattern
# 'pppdpddd', where p is a paritybit and d a databit, or '10101' (Value 21)
# will result into (pppdpdddpd) '1001101011'.
#
# NOTE: You need an parity Bit on Index 0 as an 'overall'-paritybit. NOTE 2:
# You should watch the HammingCode-video from 3Blue1Brown, which explains the
# 'rule' of encoding, including the first Index parity-bit mentioned on the
# first note.
#
# Now the only one rule for this encoding: It's not allowed to add additional
# leading '0's to the binary value That means, the binary value has to be
# encoded as it is

# Generate IP Addresses
#
# You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining,
# after which the contract will self-destruct.
#
# Given the following string containing only digits, return an array with all
# possible valid IP address combinations that can be created from the string:
#
# 3324516100
#
# Note that an octet cannot begin with a '0' unless the number itself is
# actually 0. For example, '192.168.010.1' is not a valid IP.
#
# Examples:
#
# 25525511135 -> [255.255.11.135, 255.255.111.35] 1938718066 -> [193.87.180.66]

# TODO: Implement the algorithm.

# BitBurner Playground

A backup of my BitBurner scripts, both for in-game and external challenge/contracts scripts.

*Folder structure*:
- Contracts - External python scripts for in-game contracts. Some work in progress, some complete.
- Playground - Home root folder for in-game scripts, synced via the VSCode BitBurner extension.
    - Scripts - In-game scripts folder
        - Deprecated - Old scripts that are no longer used.
        - Dev - Scripts that are still in development.
        - Early - Early scripts that are still in use, but not efficient. Good for starting out.
        - Tests - Playground for testing scripts and functions. Usually cleaned once the scripts are no longer needed.
